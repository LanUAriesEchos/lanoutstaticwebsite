Thelanout website staic because sal took my mf web ports


# TheLanout outage.  
The outage is only temporary; we will be back fully, hopefully by 2026. For now, everything is being hosted on Github with Cloudflare pages, so here is the list of events that made this outage occur.

# Ports...  
As we all know, most **HTTPS** websites use port 443 and **HTTP** websites use port 80. My brother, Siad, needs ports 443 and 80 for his VPN thingy, as he recently moved back in! The good side is that I get to see my brother again! On the bad side, he took all the web ports, and I only got 2 ports for Minecraft services, which is okay, so there is a very slim chance that TheLanoutMC returns.

> Why didn't you just say no?

Hes my brother. I can't say no to him, and saying no to literally anyone, no matter how stupid the request is in this family, is literally a death sentence. Plus, I love my brother; he's the one who basically taught me how to do computers without him. **www.thelanout.net** would not exist.

# Roadmap

 1. Get a better paying job.
 2. Find a place
 3. Get my own internet
 4. resetup the thinkcentre m93p with the website hosting software
 5. open ThelanoutMC to the public
 6. redesign website

> possible outcomes...
1. My brother moves out as I know hes planning to, I get web ports back
2. My brother accutally does what he siad and redoes my websites **DNS** settings to where if someone puts in "www.thelanout.net" into their url it sends them to My website instead of Brothers webite.


## Conclusion
TheLanout will continue serving technology help on the internet to younger folks and older folks and to new and upcoming techies! like **YOU !** Throughout the next few months [TheLanout's tech help portal](https://www.thelanout.net/tkh/) will be open!
