Title: The Sweetest Boy Otis
Date: 11/20/24
About: Otis was born on January 2, 2011, and lived to be almost 14 years old. He was a gentle, sweet, handsome cat, who loved getting brushed and screamed at us for food. Every morning at six something, he would go up onto his chair and look at us with a begging look, asking to be brushed. He would always rush my mom to bed, so he could lay on her lap. He would always ask for dinner early, and we could never resist. He purred so loud, you could hear it from another room. Whenever we ate... anything, he would jump up next to you, and beg, tapping your arm and purring so loud. Rest in peace, Otis. You were perfect.
